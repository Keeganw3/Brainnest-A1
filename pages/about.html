        Salsa originally came from Cuba and has been widely spread and is 
        now considered a big part of some Latin American cultures. This 
        has produced spin-off dance forms that have also become more 
        popular in recent years as these dances have spread and people have
        looked for more ways to enjoy themselves which is why it is so popular
        today.
